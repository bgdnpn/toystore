# ToyStore
## A naive! key-value store with flat file persistence.

This is mostly me playing around with Ruby and trying to improve my code commit by commit.
Currently very buggy, but this is the point.

Also not sure what I want to build, actual k-v store and CLI implementations are now about equal in size and importance/focus for me.

! very *naive* - in fact I initially named it NaiveStore, but ToyStore sounds better :D

TODO:
- figure out a minimally plausible use case for this and
- turn this codebase into it :D
